# Documentation  
You might be shocked to see that the first guide is geared toward documentation and not to something more flashy like methods or objects or debugging. But ask any programmer who's written a big program, and they will tell you that good documentation and coding practices are absolutely key. Additionally, there are some notes for coding school projects that won't apply when you get to the real world.  
Create a new project (name it whatever you like, but maybe a useful name like DocumentationTest might be more useful when you look back at this a few weeks from now). Then create a new class and name it "Test".  
Copy and paste the contents of the Test.java file uploaded in this directory and paste it into your Test.java file.  
Go through and read through the comments of this file. Yes, there are a LOT of comments, and honestly this is about how much you should comment all of your code. Yes, it is a bit more work as you write your code, but it will save you a lot of headache when you start forgetting what some of your code was for.  

## Where to document  
Documenting a File is done at the top, and for the purposes of a school project should look like the following:  
```
/*  
 * <Name Of File>  
 * Description of file  
 *  
 * Author  
 * Class  
 * Prof  
 *  
 */  
```    

Documenting a Class and Method should be done like the following:  
```  
/*   
 * Description of class  
 */  
public class/method Test{  
```    

Final note is on naming your variables useful terms (take your time with this) and documenting lines that are not extremely obvious.
